## What is a Gameboy Camera?

[The Game Boy Camera (GBC), released as Pocket Camera[a] in Japan, is a Nintendo accessory for the handheld Game Boy game console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Camera)

[Game Boy Camera commercial, 1998](https://twitter.com/historyinmemes/status/1569165178704633856)

## About this project

Code to emulate a gameboy printer via the gameboy link cable and an arduino module.

![](./sample_image/gameboy_printer_emulator.png)

* [Blog Post](http://briankhuu.com/projects/gameboy_camera_arduino/gameboy_camera_arduino.html)

Goal is to provide an easy way for people to quickly setup and download the images from their gameboy to their computer before the battery of these gameboy cameras dies of old age.

I hope there will be a project to collate these gameboy images somewhere.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

### Construct the Arduino Gameboy Printer Emulator

Use an arduino nano and wire the gameboy link cable as shown below.
If you can fit the gameboy camera to gameboy advance etc... you may need a
differen pinout reference. But the wiring should be similar.

* [Pinout Reference](http://www.hardwarebook.info/Game_Boy_Link)

You should avoid cutting old genuine gameboy link cables, there is plenty new cables you can purchase online. Do note that you cannot trust the color code of these cables, you must always check the wire against the plug pins. Especially considering the RX/TX pair of the pins may be flipped.

Else if you have a 3D printer, you can use (Game Boy DMG-01 Link Port plug for dupont jumper wire by Marko Å tamcar from Slovenian Computer Museum, created as part of a retro tech exhibition)[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4685189]

### Pinout Diagram

Thanks to West McGowan (twitter: @imwestm) who was able to replicate this project on his Arduino Nano plus Gameboy Color and helpfully submitted a handy picture of how to wire this project up. You can find his tutorial in [here](https://westm.co.uk/arduino-game-boy-printer-emulator/)

### General Pinout

```
Gameboy Original/Color Link Cable Pinout
 ___________
|  6  4  2  |
 \_5__3__1_/   (at cable)
```

| Arduino Pin | Gameboy Link Pin                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
|  unused     | Pin 1 : 5.0V                     |
|  D4         | Pin 2 : Serial OUTPUT            |
|  D3         | Pin 3 : Serial INPUT             |
|  unused     | Pin 4 : Serial Data              |
|  D2         | Pin 5 : Serial Clock (Interrupt) |
|  GND        | Pin 6 : GND (Attach to GND Pin)  |

### Programming the emulator

* Arduino Project File: `./GameBoyPrinterEmulator/gpb_emulator.ino`
* Baud 115200 baud

Next download `./GameBoyPrinterEmulator/gpb_emulator.ino` to your arduino nano.
After that, open the serial console and set the baud rate to 115200 baud.

#### Alternative option of uploading precompiled arduino nano image via WebUSB

If your browser supports webusb, you have the option of uploading directly to the arduino nano the firmware using WebUSB (e.g. via google chrome)

* [Arduino Nano WebSerial Firmware Flasher](./webbasedtools/arduino_nano/index.html)

Afterwards, you can check if it's working via the webusb serial console below as well

* [Arduino Nano WebSerial Serial Console](./webbasedtools/webserialConsole.html)


### Download the image (Javascript)

Press the download button in your gameboy. The emulator will automatically start to download and dump the data as a string of hex in the console display.

After the download has complete. Copy the content of the console to the raw packet javascript decoder in `./GameBoyPrinterDecoderJS/gameboy_printer_js_raw_decoder.html`. Press click to render button.

One you done that, your image will show up below. You can then right click on the image to save it to your computer. Or you can click upload to imgur to upload it to the web in public, so you can share it. (Feel free to share with me at mofosyne@gmail.com).

A copy of the raw decoder is accessible here as well:
* [V3 Raw JS Decoder: Click Here To Open Javascript Gameboy Printer Emulator Web Decoder](https://mofosyne.github.io/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator/GameBoyPrinterDecoderJS/gameboy_printer_js_raw_decoder.html)

Need example raw packet captures to test out the raw js decoder without the gameboy printer emulator hardware? You can check a few out in the [Real Packet Capture Example](https://github.com/mofosyne/GameboyPrinterSniffer/tree/master/RealCapture) folder of the gameboy printer sniffer project.

You are all done!

**Note: V3 now uses raw packet decoder, rather than the original tile decoder. This allows us to better support gameboy printers enabled games using compression.**

### Download via Game Boy Printer Web (External Project)

For those who want to take the next step and take more photos regularly you may
want to look at a partner project by Herrzatcke. Herrzatcke created a photo manager
dedicated for gameboy cameras and have already integrated support for this project
so you can easily upload photos via WebUSB or by copying and pasting raw packet data.

[Enter Game Boy Printer Web](https://herrzatacke.github.io/gb-printer-web/#/)

### Download via Android app and use the Arduino as a generic output interface for the Game Boy Printer (External Project)

For those who want to use an Android to download photos in the field, you may want to consider this partner project by Mraulio. Mraulio created an Android app to manage a Game Boy Camera gallery and communicate via usb serial with Arduino Printer Emulator and GBxCart to get images. Additionaly, when booting the Arduino board connected with the serial cable to a Game Boy Printer switched ON, the device will boot in printer mode and allow you to output images from the Android App to the printer with the exact same wire configuration. In this mode, the LED connected to pin 13 will flash ON to indicate that the printer is ready.

[Enter GBCamera Android Manager](https://github.com/Mraulio/GBCamera-Android-Manager)

### Download the image (C) (Advance User)

For advance users, in the `GameBoyPrinterDecoderC` folder there is a PC based commandline program that when compiled would allow for decoding raw packet captures into bitmap.

## Project Makeup

* Arduino sketch emulating a gameboy printer to a computer via a serial link.
    - `./GameBoyPrinterEmulator/gpb_emulator.ino` : Main source file
    - `./GameBoyPrinterEmulator/gameboy_printer_protocol.h` : Reusable header containing information about the gameboy protocol
    - The serial output is outputting a gameboy tile per line filled with hex. (Based on http://www.huderlem.com/demos/gameboy2bpp.html) Only if in tile output mode.
    - If set to tile mode, then a tile in the serial output is 16 hex char per line: e.g. `55 00 FB 00 5D 00 FF 00 55 00 FF 00 55 00 FF 00`
    - If set to raw mode, it will output the raw packet in hex, where last two bytes of each packet is the printer's response: e.g. `88 33 01 00 00 00 01 00 81 00`

* Javascript gameboy printer hex encoded packets stream rendering to image in browser.
    - [js decoder page](./GameBoyPrinterDecoderJS/gameboy_printer_js_raw_decoder.html)
    - `./GameBoyPrinterDecoderJS/gameboy_printer_js_raw_decoder.html` :
    - This is a more complicated but standard compliant way to convert the packet hex payload into canvas image that can be downloaded.

* Javascript gameboy printer hex tiles stream rendering to image in browser.
    - [js decoder page](./GameBoyPrinterDecoderJS/gameboy_printer_js_decoder.html)
    - `./GameBoyPrinterDecoderJS/gameboy_printer_js_decoder.html` :
    - This is a convenient way to convert the hex payload into canvas image that can be downloaded.

* Research folder.
    - Contains some files that I found online to research this project
    - Also a sniffer to listen to the communication between a real gameboy and a real printer that was now moved to https://github.com/mofosyne/GameboyPrinterSniffer instead

* Sample Images
    - Some sample images along with the sample logs. There has been some changes to the serial output, but the hex format remains the same.

* showcase
    - Example of what other people has used this project for.

## Research/Dev log

### 2022-04-20

* V3.2.1 includes WebUSB firmware flasher for ease of loading into an arduino nano
* Also adjusted firmware messaging to reduce confusion regarding timeout

### 2021-01-26

* V3 enable raw only mode to take advantage of better decompression on PC side
* Updated and added a showcase folder

### 2020-08-30

* V2 rewrite completed for more game support
* Sniffer created https://github.com/mofosyne/GameboyPrinterSniffer

### 2017-11-30

* Time to wrap this up. I have pushed the arduino to it's maxium ability. The show stopper to futher dev is the puny ram.
* Still cannot get CRC working. But don't really care anymore. Since its taking too much time to debug crc. Works good enough.
* There is not enough time/ram to actually do much processing of the image in the arduino. Instead the image data has to be transferred raw to over serial at 115200baud via hex, and processed futher in the computer.

### 2017-4-12

* Checksum works for init, inqiry, but not data, and possibly inqury. Possibly messed up the summation somehow. But I found that this may not matter, as the gameboy camera doesn't seem to check for it.
* While checksum worked for short messages, the checksum system didn't work for the normal data bytes. But... it seems that the gameboy printer doesn't actually pay attention to the checksum bit.
* Investigation with http://www.huderlem.com/demos/gameboy2bpp.html shows that this is actually encoded as "16 byte standard gameboy tile format".
* According to http://furrtek.free.fr/?a=gbprinter&i=2 the `The GameBoy Camera buffers tile data by blocs of 2 20 tiles wide lines.`.
